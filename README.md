# Matthew Susko's Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The portfolio showcases my projects and provides information about me. It features a modern design with 3D elements and animations.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **3D Rendering**: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) / [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
- **Animation**: [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
